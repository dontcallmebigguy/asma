Like a beautiful fragrance  
How beautiful are you  
Walking down the aisle, I imagined  
Charming with your height  
How beautiful are you  
When you talk, I can listen for days  
Your words are gold and I will never sell them  
A dream passed me and my love I imagined  
I walk pass you everyday and you're still my love  
Looking at me, I imagined  
And when they ask me about you  
I say I haven't known him  
And when I do  
I'll let him walk on the flowers I planted  
Gentle and luxury  
Who are you, I imagined  
You have the right to be arrogant  
You're a bridge, so high  
And I'll never get down  
Your eyes talk even if your quiet  
Sweet, but how much you made me fall in love  
A clear mind and a heart that is filled of love  
How lucky is your family to have you, I imagined  
I saw my letters in music  
And I thought you played it   
And don't worry  
In my heart your name is hanged  
Your name will remain known  
In my saddest and happiest days  
And if we're ever to travel the world  
You'll stay, me and you  
Special and different  
And that's how you're beautiful  
Then everyone will scream  
How beautiful is he
