So far and I feel you close  
Everytime when I see your eyes  
New feeling in my heart gathers  
I don't want you to tell me words   
That melts my heart  
I just want you to be there  
You got me with your tenderness  
You make me forget the world  
Then I found myself in love  
And I hid your love inside my soul  
If I were ever to look around the world  
I'll never find someone like  
And if I were ever to tell you that I love you  
It will never be enough  
Every heart beat, it's saying your name  
I turn and I will only see you  
I hug you in my thoughts  
I couldn't stand thinking of you every second  
Baby, you took me from everyone
