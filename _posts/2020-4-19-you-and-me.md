Have a special cloud above us  
You talk to me in a special way  
And I talk to you differently  
You and Me 
We were not two before we met 
We were one as we are now   
We were never two souls
We were one heart 
You and Me  
Were not looking for each other  
But then we had this feeling and  
We knew that we are lucky for each other  
We knew that we match from the beginning  
We had this special feeling  
I love him without rules  
He love me regardless  
And if your heart beats  
I'll say mine beats double  
And if you said I love you  
I'll say I love you  
With a millions lines under it
