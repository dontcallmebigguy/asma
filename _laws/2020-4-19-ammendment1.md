You passed me like a breeze  
So cool and soft  
With your warm soul  
Your endless tenderness  
Your sweet words  
Your lovely presence  
Your charming face  
Your bubbly personality  
Your kind gifts  
You became so precious  
I realized you owned my heart  
And I cannot stop myself from continually falling into you
